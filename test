I've created a separate Git worktree for your Gemini version!

🏗️ Worktree Details
Path: C:\PROJECTS\Sweetgrass-gemini
Branch: gemini-conductor-v1
This keeps your Gemini experimentation completely isolated from the Claude version you're working on in the main directory.

🔑 Important Next Step
Since this new folder is outside my current authorized workspace (C:\PROJECTS\Sweetgrass), I cannot see or edit the files in the Gemini worktree yet.

To let me proceed with the Conductor setup:

Add the new folder to your workspace in your editor.
Once you've done that, I'll be able to run /conductor:setup in that specific directory and help you brainstorm the spec!
💡 Brainstorming Strategy
Once I have access, here is the plan for the Gemini tree:

Ingest: I'll read your initial brainstorm.md.
Define: We'll run gemini /conductor:setup to define the "Product Intent" and "Tech Stack" specifically for this fork.
Track: We'll create a "Brainstorm Track" to turn your notes into a formal spec.md.
Ready to move to the new worktree? Just let me know once you've added it to the workspace!
