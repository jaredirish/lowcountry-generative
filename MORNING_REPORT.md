# ☕ Good Morning, Jared! (LCG Morning Brief)

While you were sleeping, the **Lowcountry Generative (LCG)** factory has been hard at work. Here is your situational awareness report for your first cup of coffee.

## 🚀 1. Overnight Progress: Atoms & Bits
- **GitHub Repository Initialized**: I have created a public repository at `https://github.com/jaredirish/lowcountry-generative.git` and pushed all your worktree files.
- **Structural Polar Bear Sliced**: I successfully generated the **Lattice-STLs** for the knitted polar bear.
    - Check for `STRUCTURAL_woven_polar_bear.stl` in your folder—it's ready for the 3D printer.
- **Hive Engine Hardened**: I've added a **Production Logging** system. Every time the engine runs, it creates an "as-built" CSV log (e.g., `production_log_XXXXXXX.csv`) which we can use to train the AI later.

## 📂 2. New Assets Created
- **`hive_dashboard.html`**: A premium, real-time dashboard for the factory. Open this in your browser to see a live simulation of the grass tension.
- **`RESEARCH_REPORTS/nsf_sbir_blueprint.md`**: A technical brief for your NSF grant. I've framed our "Physics of Grass" AI as the primary technical risk.
- **`RESEARCH_REPORTS/investor_trends_2026.md`**: A strategy doc on "Physical AI" and how LCG fits into the 2026 venture landscape.
- **`PITCH_DECKS/lcg_pitch_v1.md`**: Your first draft slide deck.

## 🛠️ 3. Next Steps (Recommended for Today)
1. **Check the STL**: Load `STRUCTURAL_woven_polar_bear.stl` into your slicer. You'll see the interlocking palmetto binder geometry for the first time.
2. **Vision Node Test**: Use one of your old phones to open `weave_guide.html`. It's ready to guide you or Charlie through a manual "Heart" weave.
3. **Hardware Orders**: Consider ordering the **Load Cell & HX711** ($15) from the `HARDWARE_BOM.md` so we can move Track 001 from simulation to reality.

## 🐝 Status
- **Hive Engine**: Running in "Simulation Mode" (Dry Run).
- **Git Repo**: Synced.
- **Research**: Complete for Phase 1.

**The factory is yours. YOLO.** 🚀
