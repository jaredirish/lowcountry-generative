# Research Report: Funding Landscape (Dec 2025 - 2026)

## 1. Government Grants (The "Non-Dilutive" Gold)
### NSF SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research)
- **Status**: Submissions temporarily paused as of late Dec 2025 due to congressional authorization, but reopening is the top priority for 2026.
- **Phase I Funding**: Up to **$305,000** for technical feasibility.
- **Strategic Category**: 
    - **Digital Health (DH1)**: Assistive, Enabling and Rehabilitative technologies.
    - **Robotics (R4)**: Robotics in Agile Manufacturing & Co-Robots.
- **Action**: Prepare the "Project Pitch" now. Focus on the **"Technical Risk"** (weaving organic non-rigid materials is hard—this is what NSF likes).

### SCRA (South Carolina Research Authority)
- **Context**: Since you are in Mt. Pleasant/Charleston, the SCRA is your best local friend.
- **Grants**: Matching grants up to $50k for early-stage tech.
- **Support**: They provide business coaching and "Relentless Challenge" funding.

## 2. Venture Capital & Angel Investors
### Target Themes for 2026
- **Generative AI for Physical Goods**: Moving beyond "Chat" and into "Action."
- **Sustainable Manufacturing**: Localized, low-carbon production using organic materials.
- **The "Longevity" Economy**: Assistive tech for aging populations (weaving as therapy/assistive textiles).

### Potential Angel Groups
- **Charleston Angel Conference**: Local high-net-worth individuals interested in Lowcountry tech.
- **Capital Angels**: Focused on the Southeast region.

## 3. Niche Research Findings
### "Assistive Cloth" Trends
- **Soft Robotics**: The move toward inflatable/flexible wearables.
- **Conductive Weaving**: Integrating sensors directly into the sweetgrass/palmetto structure to create "Smart Baskets" or "Smart Textiles."

### Competitive Landscape
- **Mainstream 3D Printing**: Too rigid.
- **Traditional Weaving**: Too slow/hard to learn.
- **LCG Position**: The middle ground. High-speed, high-precision, organic, and culturally significant.
