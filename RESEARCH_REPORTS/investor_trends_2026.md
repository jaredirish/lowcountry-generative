# Deep Research: Angel & VC Trends (2026 Strategy)

## 1. The Rise of "Physical AI"
Investors in 2026 are moving away from "SaaS-only" models. The new alpha is in **Physical AI**—intelligence that moves atoms, not just bits. LCG sits at the intersection of **Generative Manufacturing** and **Robotics**.

## 2. Key Investment Themes
- **Vertical AI**: Specialized AI models trained on proprietary physical datasets. (Our "Material Library" is our moat).
- **Agentic Manufacturing**: Factories where AI agents manage the entire lifecycle from STL-upload to autonomous weaving.
- **Climate Resilience**: Startups that solve local problems (Gullah-Geechee preservation) while scaling global solutions (plastic upcycling).

## 3. Potential Early-Stage Partners (2026 Focused)
- **Root Ventures / Playground Global**: Focused on "Hard Tech" and robotics that handle difficult materials.
- **Collaborative Fund**: Specifically interested in the intersection of culture, sustainability, and technology.
- **South Carolina Angel Network (SCAN)**: High-affinity for local heritage tech.

## 4. Market Sizing for "Generative Baskets/Textiles"
- **Bespoke Home Decor**: $12.4B Global Market.
- **Sustainable Textiles**: Expected to hit $140B by 2030.
- **Assistive Wearables**: $3.2B and growing at 14% CAGR.

## 5. Strategic Recommendation
LCG should not pitch as a "Handicraft App." It should pitch as **"The Operating System for Organic Manufacturing."** 
The sweetgrass basket is our **Falcon 1**—the first proof of concept to show that the engine works. The "Assistive Cloth" and "Robotic Furniture" markets are our **Starship**.
