# Pitch Deck: Lowcountry Generative (LCG)

## Slide 1: The Hook
**Title**: 300 Years of Tradition. 300 Milliseconds of Precision.
**Visual**: A high-res split screen: Hand-weaving in the 1700s vs. the "Weaving Hive" robotic arm.
**Narrative**: Sweetgrass weaving is a staple of Gullah-Geechee culture, but it's physically punishing and takes 10+ years to master. LCG is digitizing the dexterity.

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Text**: Organic material is unpredictable.
- Traditional manufacturing hates non-rigid materials (grass, cloth, PET).
- Artisans are aging out, and the knowledge is being lost with them.
- $XX Billion market for sustainable, bespoke home goods is stuck using plastic.

## Slide 3: The Solution (The "Woven STL")
**Text**: We built the world's first **Organic Slicer**.
- We turn 3D models into continuous, structural spirals.
- Our AI "understands" the physics of grass—when it snaps, how it bends.
- **Result**: Weaving a custom sculpture at 10x speed with 100x precision.

## Slide 4: The Technology
**Visual**: Diagram of the Hive Engine (Pi + ESP32s + Vision Nodes).
- **Computer Vision**: Old phones turned into 4K tension sensors.
- **Structural AI**: Integrated rebar maps for gravity-defying art.
- **Generative Design**: The "Slicer" turns any STL (even a Polar Bear) into a weave.

## Slide 5: The Market (WaaS - Weaving as a Service)
- **High-End Art**: $5k - $50k sculptures for hotels/galleries.
- **Sustainability**: Upcycling PET bottles into heritage-grade "Ocean Grass."
- **Assistive Tech**: Adaptive clothing using the same structural weaving logic.

## Slide 6: The Team
- **Jared Irish**: Lead Architect, Robotics/AI.
- **Charlie**: Chief Craft Officer (Training the AI Dexterity).
- **The Hive Nodes**: Our distributed robotic labor force.

## Slide 7: The Ask
**Seeking**: $300k (NSF Phase I) or Seed Investment.
**Goal**: Finish the Bimanual ALOHA rig and open the first "Generative Art Factory" in Charleston, SC.
