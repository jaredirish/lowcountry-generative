# Workflow: BMAD Method

We follow the **Breakthrough Method for Agile-Driven Development (BMAD)**, orchestrated via Gemini Conductor.

## Phases
1. **Analysis (Sprint 1-2)**: 
   - Material characterization (Load Cell testing).
   - Market validation (Fake Door sales test).
2. **Planning (Sprint 3-4)**: 
   - Architectural design of the "Slicer" engine.
   - Simulation setup in Isaac Gym.
3. **Solutioning (Sprint 5-6)**: 
   - Prototyping the "Case-Bot" (Mobile Rig).
   - Training the first "Stitch Policy" using Behavior Cloning from YouTube data.
4. **Implementation (Sprint 7+)**: 
   - Deployment of the 360° Weaving Hive.
   - Launching the AR App.

## Conventions
- **Code First**: Use Python for AI/CV and TypeScript for App logic.
- **Documentation**: Every track must have a `spec.md` and `plan.md`.
- **Safety**: Bimanual manipulation must include real-time collision avoidance.
