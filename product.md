# Product Context: Sweetgrass Pathways / Lowcountry Generative (LCG)

## Vision
To preserve and evolve the 300-year-old Gullah-Geechee tradition of sweetgrass weaving by integrating advanced Computer Vision, Augmented Reality, and Robotics. Transforming a manual craft into a "Generative Art Factory."

## Core Pillars
1. **Education (Sweetgrass Pathways)**: An AR-guided mobile experience to teach the physical dexterity of weaving.
2. **Design (Sweetgrass Slicer)**: A generative CAD engine that converts 3D models into continuous-spiral weaving paths.
3. **Production (Wando Works)**: An automated robotic workcell for high-volume and bespoke "Weaving as a Service" (WaaS).

## Key Features
- **AR Weave Overlay**: Projecting a virtual "ghost" of the next stitch via Pixel 9 Pro camera.
- **Haptic Tension Monitor**: Using smartwatch sensors to coach the user on the "Gullah cadence" and pull-strength.
- **Physics-Aware Slicer**: An algorithm that understands the "Minimum Bend Radius" and tensile strength of grass bundles.
- **Hybrid Materials**: Combining sweetgrass with recycled PET (plastic bottles) and copper wire skeletons (rebar).

## Target Audience
- **Tourists/Hobbyists**: Learning the craft via AR.
- **Artists/Collectors**: Purchasing high-end, robotically-woven sculptures.
- **Sustainability Partners**: Upcycling ocean-bound plastic into heritage art.
- **Local Artisans**: Using "Artisan Proxy" robots to scale their business.
